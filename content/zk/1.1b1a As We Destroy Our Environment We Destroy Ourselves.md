## Content

Just as the common view of dualism creates a separation between body and mind, the common belief is to view humanity as separate from nature. This is evidenced through the common motif of man vs. nature in literature. In fact, humans are one with nature, as the wave is one with the ocean. Thus as we destroy the environment we likewise destroy ourselves. This isn't just because we are making our environment inhospitable to life, but because we ourselves are inseparable from our environment. 

Most people have a false sense of personal identity,  where we fail to recognize that we are a product of our environment, of nature. This false sense of identity leads to a fundamental misunderstanding of nature itself and our place within it. As we destroy nature we are likewise destroying ourselves.[^1]
