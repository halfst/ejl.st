## Content

Physicalism, often equated with materialism, is a philosophical position which states that all existence is ultimately physical or can be described by the physical. Reductionist Physicalism, in particular, claims that even complex systems can be explained by being broken down into their component physical parts (Non-reductionist Physicalism states that complex systems can be explained via more complex sciences, for example, psychology). Physicalism is contrasted with dualism, which states that there are separate irreducible physical and mental (or spiritual) entities to reality.
