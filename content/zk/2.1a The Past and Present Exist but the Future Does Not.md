## Content

The growing block view of time contends that there is no such thing as the future, since it is undetermined, but that the past and present do exist.[^1] As the future becomes the present, it is added onto the "growing block" of time, supporting the theory that the universe is growing.[^2]

> Growing Block (GB) theorists are committed, roughly, to two theses: (1) that past and present events exist and that future events do not, and (2) that the present is dynamic and constantly changing.
> -Katarina Perović
