## Content

It's untrue that people don't change. People actually change constantly. This is scientifically true through the concept of neuroplasticity. All aspects of your being change, whether it's your personality, identity, perceptions, or experience. The true human experience is one that is continuously in flux. We are as much changing as we would like to perceive ourselves as stable.
