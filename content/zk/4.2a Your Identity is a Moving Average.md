## Content

Your identity and ego are continuously in flux, with the "you" that you are being defined as the average of your behaviors, choices, thoughts, ideals, relationships, etc., over any given period of time. It's possible for other people's perceptions of your identity to also change over time, as their beliefs about who you are are reinforced or challenged.
