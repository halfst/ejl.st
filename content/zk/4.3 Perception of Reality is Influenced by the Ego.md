## Content

Our ego is constructed from a myriad of influences, from societal norms, past experiences, the constellation of our family experience, and countless other factors. In turn, the ego influences our perception of our reality, insofar as we create a subjective reality by filtering external stimuli through the lens of our constructed reality. This results in a dualistic view of nature, with our self as the object and the outside world as the subject.[^1]
