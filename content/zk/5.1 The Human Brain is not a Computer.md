## Content

The brain is not a computer, it's more like a transducer, converting patterns of energy into our sensory experience.[^1] A computer has perfect recall over events. Our memories, in contrast, are constructed as a neural network of various disparate elements.[^2] Unlike a computer, we are never born with, nor will we develop, algorithms, models, memories, processors, subroutines, etc. Instead, we rely on our inborn reflexes and capacity to learn in order to function.[^3]
