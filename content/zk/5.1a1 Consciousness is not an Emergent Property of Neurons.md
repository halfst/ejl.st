## Content

Unlike wetness, which is emergent property of large concentration of H20 molecules, consciousness isn't an emergent property of a high concentration of neurons. This is obvious when people who have had damage to the cerebellum, which contains 80% of the neurons in the brain, and yet there is no perceivable loss of consciousness.[^1] Likewise, people can have their spinal cord severed, resulting in quadriplegia and the loss of 200 million neurons, yet with no loss in consciousness.[^2] Consciousness doesn't simply arise out of the complexity afforded by a large number of neurons.[^3]
