## Highlights
- If we remain settled, when the mind is moving, if you don't get involved, you start to see, I don't have to be involved. Habitually dependent on my thoughts and feelings to give me the sense I am me. But when I don't do that, I can be reborn. That is to say, I am not who I think I am.

    - Note: If we remain still within the swirling of our minds, we begin to see that we are not dependent on our thoughts and feelings to define who we are, meaning we can redefine who we are.
