## Highlights
- Episode AI notes
  1. The pursuit of happiness is often misguided due to misconceptions about what truly brings lasting fulfillment. People often believe that external achievements or possessions will make them happy, but this only provides temporary happiness.
  2. Affective forecasting errors, where people mispredict their future emotions, can lead to disappointment. Setting specific goals for happiness, such as obtaining a promotion or earning more money, may not always result in the expected level of happiness.
  3. Even wealthy individuals can have mistaken intuitions about money and experience mental health problems. Becoming a millionaire does not guarantee long-term happiness.
