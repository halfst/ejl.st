- - Thoughts exist within the mind, similar to a reflection in a mirror.
  - They are inseparable, just as a reflection cannot exist independently of the mirror.
  Transcript:
  Unknown Speaker
  When you really see, my mind has content, but the content is not the same as the mind, it's not other than the mind, it's like the reflection in the mirror. You never have a reflection without a mirror. The reflection is always in the mirror. You can't take the reflection out of the mirror. So, you never have thoughts without a mind. The thoughts are, as it were, in the mind. And you cannot take the thought out of the mind.

- - The Depression Triangle consists of three negative beliefs.
  - These are: believing there's nothing good in oneself, the world, and the future.
  Transcript:
  Unknown Speaker
  Aram Beck, one of the founders of modern cognitive behavioral therapy, one of the first useful things he did was he developed what he called the Depression Triangle, which is the three Points on the triangle. So it's three beliefs. One is, there's nothing good in me. Second is, there's nothing good in the world around me. Third is, there's nothing good in the future. And when these three factors lock together, this is high direction towards depression, hopelessness, and eventually suicide. Because I'm crap, everything's crap, and the future's gone.

- - Use meditation to confront rigid definitions and ideas.
  - Stay with these constructs long enough to see their ephemeral nature and experience a sense of liberation.
  Transcript:
  Unknown Speaker
  So this is what meditation is for, is to bring us to the point where we directly sit with these intense, compressed definitions, ideas, and we stay with them long enough to see that they Dissolve. That actually they are ephemeral. They are like a dream, like a spider's web, like a rainbow in the sky. There is no substance to them. But if you just glance off them, they seem to be real and real and real. So we sit and we allow the dissolving of the constructs of the mind and then we find we're naked, fresh, alive, available.
