## Highlights
- **Non-Duality of Mind**
  * The concept of non-duality is illustrated using the example of a mirror and its reflection, and ocean and waves.
  * They appear as separate entities, but they are inseparable and exist simultaneously.
  **Notes:**
  * This relates to Alan Watts talking about environment and organism being the same.

  There is a mirror and there is a reflection. I've got too much of one and not enough of the other. But the fact is that the mirror and the reflection are non-dual. They come together. They are at the same time. Or another traditional example, in the ocean you have waves. When you go to the sea, you see these waves coming up and going down. There is the ocean and the wave. But clearly, the wave is not different from the ocean. Now, if you say the wave is the same as the ocean... You've put both into a blender of some kind, because you've lost the precision of now the wave is arising. And you can feel that, oh, oh, I'm rippling sometimes. So there is a wave and there is an ocean. But what we have is wave ocean, wave ocean. And the wave and the ocean are not two, and they're not one. So when you really see that, that's the meaning of non-duality. Of course, the wave and the ocean are just water.

- **Uncontrived Presence**
  - Uncontrived presence is achieved by not going anywhere else mentally.
  - It's the act of going somewhere else, like daydreaming or getting distracted, that requires effort.

  Unknown Speaker
  We find ourselves in that, as that, by not going anywhere else. So we're here intrinsically without effort because we haven't gone anywhere else. It's the going somewhere else that takes the effort. You put energy into daydreaming or being distracted or preparing or trying to remember what you have to buy from the shops before they close. All kind of things can catch our mind. This is uncontrived. When you stop contriving, when you stop being artificial, when you stop art, when you stop constructing and making, nothing to do. It's here. It's already here. I am inside the being here-ness. So this is very different from the view of many Dharma practices that say we are wandering in samsara, we are lost, we are confused, we have def poisons. We've accumulated so much karma. We have to purify ourselves. We have to gather merit and wisdom. There's a lot to do. You say, don't do any of this. Don't do anything. Some of us remember from Siyalama's prayer, Mach Dharmakaya, the mind of the Buddha, is free of all positions and
