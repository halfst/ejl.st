## Highlights
- Perception Shapes Reality
  Summary:
  The sense of self is constructed through a myriad of influences—including past behaviors, family dynamics, personal experiences, health, and societal perceptions—creating a distorted projection of reality.
  This habitual filtering impedes genuine interaction with the world. However, achieving unmediated responsivity is possible through the practice of non-duality, where the divisions between self and other dissolve, allowing for a more authentic engagement with life.
  Exploring pathways to reach this state requires intentional contemplation.

  That's what happens when we construe things through the filtering system of the habitual construction of our sense of self. Patterns generated from the Buddhist mind of view, from the impact of our behaviors in previous lives, the constellation of our family, our birth experience, how the mood was in the Family, schooling, occupations, whether we're healthy or unhealthy, whether the world sees us as attractive or not. All of these factors lead to little prisms of self and each moment is refracted through these prisms and so we have this complex projection of appearances which we then take to be strongly Real. This is our normal situation. The possibility is to move into an unmediated responsivity so that as the world is arising, we are manifesting with that world. That's what's normally described as non-duality, in which the barrier or the separation between self and other is less operative. So then we have to think, okay how would we get there?

- Understanding Reality Requires Unlearning Labels
  Summary:
  The mind’s energy manifests as subject and object, creating dualities such as experiencer and experienced.
  This results in a deeper ignorance tied to identification, where subjective labels and descriptions obscure true reality. As individuals develop concepts and classifications, they mistakenly believe they gain clarity and power.
  However, from a Buddhist perspective, this process leads to a delusion, as all descriptions are mere creations rather than accurate representations of existence.
  The understanding of reality is hindered by culturally reinforced conceptual elaborations, prompting a need to unlearn these labels to recognize the true nature of experience.

  Appearing to fragment because of these pulsations of energy. The energy is the energy of the mind, which we can start to explore in meditation and if you come at the weekend we'll do this in more detail. As this thickening of the energy arises, it starts to manifest in the form of subject and object. There is, seems to be, an experiencer and an experienced. This leads to the second level of ignorance, which is the ignorance of naming everything, of identification. So, I am like this, you are like that. This is an oak tree, this is a birch tree. Coffee doesn't taste like tea. And the more you go into conceptual elaboration, the more you go into developing concepts, it is as if you are gaining more power to identify and describe what is there. From the Buddhist point of view this is the force field of the great delusion that we live within. Because what is actually happening of course is that there is no such thing as description. All description is creation, that the world comes into being according to our means of constellating experience and the more that constellation is coming through our culturally Approved, reinforced through education,
