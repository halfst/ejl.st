## Highlights
- Fleeting notes form the basis for much of what you’ll create inside your zettelkasten, though they themselves will not make it past the velvet rope. Fleeting notes live in a state of potential, waiting to be transformed into more useful “main notes,” the notes that will make up the bulk of your zettelkasten.

- The most important thing about any form of reference note-making is to, at some point, return to the note. It’s the “going back” that makes all the difference, understanding that your initial scribble isn’t the end of the capture. It’s the beginning. A reference note is to be used as a reference. Its contents to be transformed into main notes.

- If you tend to read digital books, you can still do the steps above, but also have the option of using one of the many “read later” apps to store your highlights and notes. If you use this approach, I recommend bringing these captures into a separate reference note file, as notes stored in read later apps can quickly pile up and become unpleasant to work through.

- In its most basic form, a main note should have at least two components:
  • a single idea, and
  • a link to another idea stored in your zettelkasten

- Other elements that can be included in your main notes are:
  • a title
  • a quote or reference to where the idea comes from
  • a record pointing to where and how the idea has been used in your writing
  • a unique ID

- A main note works best when the thought contained inside has been pared down to its essentials. Having a single idea to contend with means you won’t be sifting through counterarguments and varying points of view. Instead, you’ll be dealing with a single unit of information that freely associates with others [(4.5)](private://read/01j8xt5k5wh9krcnskg8nxym23/#_idTextAnchor053)

- Links are used to establish relationships between ideas. By connecting thoughts, we give ourselves options, turning isolated, single-idea notes into long-form trains of thought.

- Creating Main Notes from Fleeting Notes
  Retype or copy/paste the idea into a new file, rewriting it if necessary, using complete sentences that capture the crux of the thought you’re trying to convey. Consider if/how this idea relates to another already stored in your zettelkasten. If the idea is unrelated to anything else, edit the idea so it’s readable, and import it without linking the idea to others. If the idea relates to another already networked in your slip box, either rewrite it to speak directly to the other idea, or reference the previously captured idea and state why you’re making the connection.

- Creating Main Notes from Your Own Writing
  While it may seem obvious that main notes will be created from passing thoughts and other people’s ideas, your own writing can also be used as a source for main notes. Blogs, articles, newsletters, tweets, emails, and comments on forums can all be parsed out and repurposed as main notes to be reused in other pieces of writing or thought work.

- It’s perfectly acceptable to incorporate questions into your zettelkasten, since these can serve as both placeholders for future answers and prompts for shorter writing pieces. But, questions left unanswered are a somewhat low-value form of content. After all, how will a question help you in your writing if you don’t know the answer? Where is the idea you want to get across? In order for questions to become useful, they need to be transformed into something usable.
  One way to level-up a question is to embed it in a declaration. To do so, ask yourself why the question is important. What feelings does the question bring up? Is the question common?

- Whether you’re involved in a technical field, doing academic research, or just trying to keep track of what others have said about a topic, there are a variety of reasons why you may want (or need) to capture facts, definitions, and/or technical data in your zettelkasten.

- Creating a hub note is relatively simple. First, choose a section of your zettelkasten where the theme has been taken into a variety of places via different trains of thought. Once you’ve decided on a section to work with, create a new note, and give it a name that identifies the topic you’ll be exploring. Next, identify which notes within the section initiate the various trains of thought.

- In contrast to hub notes, which contain lists of notes pointing toward trains of thought developing in your zettelkasten, structure notes are spaces where the contents of those trains of thought can be developed further. In order to see how your ideas relate semantically—how they might function as a coherent train of thought—they need to be exported to a place where you can unpack them. Structure notes are where this happens.

- Creating a structure note can be as simple as organizing a list of notes or ideas in a way that makes sense, added to over time, as new ideas come into the zettelkasten.

- This initial gathering of notes gives you something to work with. Once you’ve collected a few ideas, begin organizing them in a way that makes sense, giving context for the choices you make. Then, look through your zettelkasten for other ideas that speak to the developing theme of the structure note, once again giving context to the notes you’ve included. Fig. 44 shows what an evolved structure note can look like.

- Taking the time to organize and explain the relationships between the ideas you’ve collected will help you understand your own thinking on the topic, while at the same time leading to additional thoughts that can also be included in the structure note. You may also uncover areas of your thinking that lack substance or are missing completely.

- Hub notes and structure notes are, by design, relatively prescribed ways of engaging with the zettelkasten. Niklas Luhmann’s keyword index,[87](private://read/01j8xt5k5wh9krcnskg8nxym23/#_idTextAnchor196) on the other hand, functioned like an oracle.
  Luhmann’s keyword index wasn’t exhaustive. At most, each listed keyword had only four references to where the term could be found (in a slip box containing over sixty thousand notes!). The assumption was the references in the notes would be enough to direct Luhmann where he needed to go once he entered the slip box.[88](private://read/01j8xt5k5wh9krcnskg8nxym23/#_idTextAnchor197)

- Indexing is personal.[93](private://read/01j8xt5k5wh9krcnskg8nxym23/#_idTextAnchor202) Whether you choose to embrace Luhmann’s penchant for serendipity by creating a keyword index that only hints at what you’ll find, or decide to create something more comprehensive and explicit, the index you keep need only serve your purposes.

- Regardless of which approach you take, keywords need not only speak to topics and themes. They could also point toward emotions and experiences. If you want to feel your way through your ideas, you might include indexed references to “Ideas that make me laugh” or “Ideas that make me want to change the world.” You might also include references to repeated situations in which certain ideas arise: “Ideas that arise in therapy,” or “Morning walking thoughts.” So long as your index helps you engage with your zettelkasten, it’s a functioning index.

- Rather than structuring his zettelkasten around topical categories or as a hierarchical tree structure, Luhmann chose instead to allow his compartment of main notes to develop bottom-up, its structure emerging out of the relationships between ideas, sections emerging over time.

- Imagine taking notes on a book about homesteading, thinking you’re going to write articles on the history of back-to-the-land movements in the United States, only to find the majority of the citations in your reference note came from a chapter on basket weaving. When the majority of your captures have to do with weaving baskets, even though you’ve ne’er a basket weaved, at some point you have to face facts: you’re interested in woven satchels. It’s in this way that reference notes show us our real interests as opposed to those that are mere wishful thinking.

- Sometimes an idea just wants to move, so much so that any attempt to capture it in a single note proves a hopeless endeavor. Whenever I encounter a runaway idea, I have a choice to make:
  • Break the long-note into several main notes, or
  • Convert the long-note into an article
  To make it easy, I do both (Fig. 46).

- Always take advantage of inspiration. If capturing an idea turns into writing an article, continue writing the article. After you’ve finished the piece or taken a break from writing, go back and find the ideas that didn’t make it into your zettelkasten, turning each one into a main note

- All the examples in this chapter show how a zettelkasten can point toward what to write about. None, however, suggest the zettelkasten should do the writing for you. And, the reason is simple: Your zettelkasten is a terrible writer.
  The ideas you’ve been capturing in your main notes weren’t written in the context of any one specific piece of writing. These ideas need to be framed in light of the subject you’re writing about, the overall theme of the work, and your chosen tone. Ahrens reminds would-be writers to avoid copying notes into manuscripts, stating that writers should instead “[t]ranslate [ideas] into something coherent” by embedding the ideas “into the context of the argument.”[98](private://read/01j8xt5k5wh9krcnskg8nxym23/#_idTextAnchor207) This is advice worth heeding.

- Aside from unchecked (and undeserved) hubris, one of the reasons why working with a zettelkasten often leads to poor writing has to do with fragmentation, or as Richard Griffiths at writingslowly.com puts it, “the illusion that disjointed fragments can produce integrated thought.”[123](private://read/01j8xt5k5wh9krcnskg8nxym23/#_idTextAnchor232) Despite the connections you’ve made and the reasoning you’ve given for each one, relationships between ideas must be reframed in the context of the piece you’re working on. This means rewriting ideas, shaping them to express what you want.

- • Take advantage of runaway ideas by transforming long, complex notes into rough drafts. Then parse out your ideas into individual main notes.
  • Don’t let your zettelkasten write for you. Develop your writing craft by editing your ideas and unpacking and expressing the relationships between them.
