## Highlights
- The backbone of this book is my four-step model of habits—cue, craving, response, and reward—and the four laws of behavior change that evolve out of these steps.

- the framework I offer is an integrated model of the cognitive and behavioral sciences. I believe it is one of the first models of human behavior to accurately account for both the influence of external stimuli and internal emotions on our habits.

- It is so easy to overestimate the importance of one defining moment and underestimate the value of making small improvements on a daily basis.

- Breakthrough moments are often the result of many previous actions, which build up the potential required to unleash a major change.

- If you find yourself struggling to build a good habit or break a bad one, it is not because you have lost your ability to improve. It is often because you have not yet crossed the Plateau of Latent Potential. Complaining about not achieving success despite working hard is like complaining about an ice cube not melting when you heated it from twenty-five to thirty-one degrees. Your work was not wasted; it is just being stored. All the action happens at thirty-two degrees.

- That’s the counterintuitive thing about improvement. We think we need to change our results, but the results are not the problem. What we really need to change are the systems that cause those results.

- Changing our habits is challenging for two reasons: (1) we try to change the wrong thing and (2) we try to change our habits in the wrong way.

- There are three layers of behavior change: a change in your outcomes, a change in your processes, or a change in your identity.

^rw455027449
- Many people begin the process of changing their habits by focusing on what they want to achieve. This leads us to outcome-based habits. The alternative is to build identity-based habits. With this approach, we start by focusing on who we wish to become.

    - Note: Link to "identity based behavioral change"
^rw455027450
- True behavior change is identity change. You might start a habit because of motivation, but the only reason you’ll stick with one is that it becomes part of your identity. Anyone can convince themselves to visit the gym or eat healthy once or twice, but if you don’t shift the belief behind the behavior, then it is hard to stick with long-term changes.

- Good habits can make rational sense, but if they conflict with your identity, you will fail to put them into action.

- The most practical way to change who you are is to change what you do.
    -  Location 518, [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/455027463)
^rw455027463
- For example, “Who is the type of person who could write a book?” It’s probably someone who is consistent and reliable. Now your focus shifts from writing a book (outcome-based) to being the type of person who is consistent and reliable (identity-based).
    -  Location 537, [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/455027464)
^rw455027464
- This is the feedback loop behind all human behavior: try, fail, learn, try differently. With practice, the useless movements fade away and the useful actions get reinforced. That’s a habit forming.
    -  Location 601, [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/455027465)
^rw455027465
- The process of building a habit can be divided into four simple steps: cue, craving, response, and reward.
    -  Location 627, [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/455027476)
^rw455027476
- It is a bit of information that predicts a reward. Our prehistoric ancestors were paying attention to cues that signaled the location of primary rewards like food, water, and sex. Today, we spend most of our time learning cues that predict secondary rewards like money and fame, power and status, praise and approval, love and friendship, or a sense of personal satisfaction. (Of course, these pursuits also indirectly improve our odds of survival and reproduction, which is the deeper motive behind everything we do.)
    -  Location 633, [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/455027477)
^rw455027477
- What you crave is not the habit itself but the change in state it delivers.
    -  Location 639, [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/455027478)
^rw455027478
- Every craving is linked to a desire to change your internal state.
    -  Location 641, [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/455027480)
^rw455027480
- The thoughts, feelings, and emotions of the observer are what transform a cue into a craving.
    -  Location 645, [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/455027481)
^rw455027481
- The response is the actual habit you perform, which can take the form of a thought or an action.
    -  Location 646, [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/455027482)
^rw455027482

- implementation intention, which is a plan you make beforehand about when and where to act. That is, how you intend to implement a particular habit. The cues that can trigger a habit come in a wide range of forms—the feel of your phone buzzing in your pocket, the smell of chocolate chip cookies, the sound of ambulance sirens—but the two most common cues are time and location. Implementation intentions leverage both of these cues.
    -  Location 902, [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/461541724)
^rw461541724
- Implementation intentions leverage both of these cues. Broadly speaking, the format for creating an implementation intention is: “When situation X arises, I will perform response Y.”

- The simple way to apply this strategy to your habits is to fill out this sentence: I will [BEHAVIOR] at [TIME] in [LOCATION].
    -  Location 922, [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/461541731)
^rw461541731
- Many human behaviors follow this cycle. You often decide what to do next based on what you have just finished doing. Going to the bathroom leads to washing and drying your hands, which reminds you that you need to put the dirty towels in the laundry, so you add laundry detergent to the shopping list, and so on. No behavior happens in isolation. Each action becomes a cue that triggers the next behavior.

^rw461541732
- One of the best ways to build a new habit is to identify a current habit you already do each day and then stack your new behavior on top. This is called habit stacking.
    -  Location 958, [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/461541733)
^rw461541733
- The habit stacking formula is: “After [CURRENT HABIT], I will [NEW HABIT].”

- Consider when you are most likely to be successful. Don’t ask yourself to do a habit when you’re likely to be occupied with something else.

- In this way, the most common form of change is not internal, but external: we are changed by the world around us. Every habit is context dependent.

- When scientists analyze people who appear to have tremendous self-control, it turns out those individuals aren’t all that different from those who are struggling. Instead, “disciplined” people are better at structuring their lives in a way that does not require heroic willpower and self-control. In other words, they spend less time in tempting situations.

^rw488141824
- Temptation bundling is one way to apply a psychology theory known as Premack’s Principle. Named after the work of professor David Premack, the principle states that “more probable behaviors will reinforce less probable behaviors.” In other words, even if you don’t really want to process overdue work emails, you’ll become conditioned to do it if it means you get to do something you really want to do along the way.

- refer to this as the difference between being in motion and taking action. The two ideas sound similar, but they’re not the same. When you’re in motion, you’re planning and strategizing and learning. Those are all good things, but they don’t produce a result. Action, on the other hand, is the type of behavior that will deliver an outcome. If I outline twenty ideas for articles I want to write, that’s motion. If I actually sit down and write an article, that’s action. If I search for a better diet plan and read a few books on the topic, that’s motion. If I actually eat a healthy meal, that’s action.

- All habits follow a similar trajectory from effortful practice to automatic behavior, a process known as automaticity. Automaticity is the ability to perform a behavior without thinking about each step, which occurs when the nonconscious mind takes over.

- Conventional wisdom holds that motivation is the key to habit change. Maybe if you really wanted it, you’d actually do it. But the truth is, our real motivation is to be lazy and to do what is convenient. And despite what the latest productivity best seller will tell you, this is a smart strategy, not a dumb one.

- The greater the obstacle—that is, the more difficult the habit—the more friction there is between you and your desired end state. This is why it is crucial to make your habits so easy that you’ll do them even when you don’t feel like it.
