## Highlights
- There is a broader point here about customer support. If you see it as simply a triaging system, then you’re likely going to land with the likes of Todoist and other companies that struggle with retaining customers. However, if you see customer support as an integral part of the customer journey, not just supporting the customer during moments of pain but also helping them get stronger, then you will retain customers for life who will find every opportunity to sing your praises.
