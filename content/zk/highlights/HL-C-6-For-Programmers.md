## Highlights
- Line 1 begins with `//`, indicating that the remainder of the line is a comment. We begin every source-code file with a comment indicating the figure number and the name of the file in which the code is stored.

- using System;
  is a using **directive** that tells the compiler where to look for a class that’s used in this app. A great strength of Visual C# is its rich set of predefined classes that you can *reuse* rather than “reinventing the wheel.” These classes are organized under **namespaces**—named collections of related classes.

- class Welcome1
  begins a **class declaration** for the class named `Welcome1`. Every app consists of at least one class declaration that’s defined by you. These are known as **user-defined classes**.

- A class declaration’s file name is usually the class name followed by the `.cs` file-name extension

- By convention, a file that contains a single class should have a name that’s identical to the class name

- A **left brace**, `{` (in line 6 in [Fig. 3.1](#ch03fig01)), begins each class declaration’s **body**. A corresponding **right brace**, `}`

- static void Main()
  is where the app begins execution—this is known as the entry point. The **parentheses** after the identifier `Main` indicate that it’s a **method**. Class declarations normally contain one or more methods.

- The left brace in line 9 begins the **body of the method declaration**. A corresponding right brace ends the body (line 11). Line 10 in the method body is indented between the braces

- Console.WriteLine("Welcome to C# Programming!");
  instructs the computer to **perform an action**—namely, to display the **string** of characters between the double quotation marks, which delimit the string.

- The entire line 10, including `Console.WriteLine`, the parentheses, the argument `"Welcome to C# Programming!"` in the parentheses and the **semicolon** (;), is called a **statement**. Most statements end with a semicolon.

- By convention, variable-name identifiers begin with a lowercase letter, and every word in the name after the first word begins with a capital letter (e.g., firstNumber). This naming convention is known as camel case.
