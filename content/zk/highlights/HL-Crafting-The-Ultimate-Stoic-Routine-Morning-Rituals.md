## Highlights
- Embrace the Art of Elimination for True Excellence
  Summary:
  The philosophy of essentialism advocates for the disciplined pursuit of less in order to achieve excellence.
  To be truly successful, one must acknowledge that being good at certain things inherently means being bad at others. Accepting this reality allows individuals to identify and eliminate activities that do not contribute to their primary goals, thereby freeing up time and energy to focus on what truly matters.
  This prioritization not only fosters success but also cultivates a mindset that embraces imperfection in less critical areas.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  So I'm also a big fan of the philosophy of essentialism, which can be described as the disciplined pursuit of less. I'll create a course on this in the coming months, but the idea is that, in order to be excellent at something, you have to be bad at something else. In order to be successful, you have to be unsuccessful. An essentialist is okay with this. An essentialist just accepts, hey, here are the things I'm not going to be good at, here are the things I'm not going to spend my time doing. And by doing that, I'll also have time to focus on the things that really matter.

    - Note: Essentialism is the philosophy of the disciplined pursuit of less. Essentialists believe that in order to excel at one thing you need to be bad at something else, and so their time and energy is pared down to focusing on only those essential things. Similar to the concept of focusing on strengths, Strengthsfinders, etc.
