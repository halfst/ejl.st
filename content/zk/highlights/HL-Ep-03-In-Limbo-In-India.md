## Highlights
- Reverence in Service: The Exchange of Blessings
  Summary:
  Embracing the role of a holy man involves a complex interplay of humility and recognition of others' spiritual journeys.
  Rather than succumbing to ego or societal hype around religious status, true reverence lies in acknowledging the value of those who seek blessings. This involves reciprocating their respect in spirit while maintaining the sanctity of the role, thus enhancing their spiritual experiences.
  The act of offering blessings back to those who revere you creates a sacred exchange, acknowledging both their needs and your role in facilitating their spiritual growth.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  So I talked to Bhagawan Dasabhata the final I was with and we decided to give it away to a beggar but I kept one paisa because it was the first time that I found that it paid to be a holy man. And there was that much profaneness in me that I thought that you appreciate that at the same time because it was too embarrassing to seriously consider myself a holy man because my western Mind wouldn't give in that much. I mean I know what kind of a hype religion is you're not going to catch me and coming on like one of those guys. That was my feeling. And Bhagawan Dasabh said when people reverence you because of the role you're in they are doing it and it's helping their spiritual work to do this and the way you can handle it he says The way I handle it is I reverence them back because you're a holy man you don't bow like they come out and they touch your feet people run out from shops to touch your feet as you walk by and You don't do that to them because you're in your role but in your heart you touch their feet you reverence them and he said then you're offering them the blessing that they've come to receive And it's one you know that which is pure and you're offering to them. Okay that was fair enough I was willing to do that.
