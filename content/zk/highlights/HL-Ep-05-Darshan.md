## Highlights
- Gaze into the Depths of Connection
  Summary:
  True connection with others requires vulnerability; avoiding risk prevents genuine interaction.
  Recognizing the depth of another's presence involves seeing beyond superficial layers and acknowledging a shared consciousness. This awareness transforms eye contact from a power play to a mutual exploration of pure energy and love.
  Engaging deeply with another creates a space where both individuals can witness their interactions from a higher perspective, resulting in a profound bond that transcends mere acquaintance.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  You because I'm not vulnerable. I'm not going to be hurt. There's no risk. There's no risk at all. And when you once know where that place is with another human being, you realize you can't have it because you're just dripping yourself so badly. I can tell when somebody comes to see me, I look into their eyes. You see, now in the old days when I look into somebody's eyes, it was a power play. You know, want to control them or show them how much I, how deep I was or look to see what they would, you know, I was doing something. I was doing something. Now I look at somebody's eyes and I'm doing mantra. I'm just empty, but I'm really here. I can feel their eyes and sometimes you look into somebody's eyes and it's like a deep bottomless well and they're just there at every level, every level you touch upon, they're there. They're just so, it's just pure consciousness that you meet. And others, you go just so far and you feel a level drop because it's too risky to get in that close. I mean, I just met you. How can I be in love with you? I only look that way and people, you know, that kind of thing. And to realize that that place that you are, which is pure consciousness, which is, I'll play a little game with you and give you the clues. It's light, it's energy, it's all so love. It's the same exact place. It's perusha. It's pure energy. It's the same place in you as it is in me. And when we look that way, we are in that place together. And then we are both witnessing all the rest of our acts, which is all out there from this other place.
