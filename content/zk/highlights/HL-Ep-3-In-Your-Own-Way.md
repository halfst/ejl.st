- Hierarchy of consciousness in the universe
  Summary:
  Every conscious creature in the universe perceives itself as a human being with a sense of hierarchy above and below.
  Even tiny creatures like fruit flies have their own awareness and judgments about beings around them, while they perceive human beings as beyond their comprehension. This illustrates a hierarchy of consciousness and awareness present throughout the universe.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  Part one, one of the first things which everybody should understand is that every creature in the universe that is in any way sensitive and in any manner of speaking conscious, regards Itself as a human being. That is to say, it knows and is aware of a hierarchy of beings above it and a hierarchy of beings below it. If you take such a tiny creature as a fruit fly, which lives only a few days, it is aware of all sorts of weird little animals and objects and spores floating in the atmosphere, which we Don't even notice unless we've got a microscope around, and very few people have. And it criticises them as being inferior animals ander all that sort of thing. Whereas human beings are things that it doesn't comprehend, they are as much outside its er intellect as a quesa is outside ours. And we see these far off objects floating in the heavens, and we have only the vaguest idea of what may be.
