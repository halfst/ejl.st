## Highlights
- Expanding Perception Beyond Limits
  Summary:
  Our fixed perceptions limit our understanding of the world.
  By associating specific shapes and colors with objects like leaves, we impose restrictions on our perception. Lautze's statement that 'the five colours make a man blind, the five tones make a man deaf' emphasizes that by restricting our perception to a limited number of colors or tones, we are essentially blocking ourselves from truly experiencing the infinite variety present in the world.
  To truly see and hear the world, we must let go of these fixed conceptions and be open to the infinite possibilities of color and sound.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  Because, say, when a person says, i see a leaf, immediately one thinks of a spear head shaped thing outlined in black and filled in with flat green. No leaf looks like that. No leaves. Leaves are not green. That's why lautze said, the five colours make a man blind, the five tones make a man deaf. Because if you can only see five colours, you're blind. And if you can only hear five tones in music, you're deaf. You see ifyou. If you force sound into five tones, you force colour into five colours, you are blind and deaf. The world of colour is infinite, as is the world of sound. And it is only through stopping fixing conceptions on the world of colour and sound that you really begin to hear it and see it.
