## Highlights
- People are happy when they feel a sense of control over their thoughts and feelings. When this happens, we experience a “flow” state: We enjoy ourselves, we feel a sense of purpose and meaning, and other things don’t seem to matter as much.

- When you get feedback that doesn’t align with your goals, you experience fear and anxiety, making working on your goals difficult. Csikszentmihalyi calls this “disorder in consciousness” or “psychic entropy”: Your attention is divided, making it near-impossible to achieve a flow state.

- To reach a flow state and accomplish your goals, you need to direct your attention. When your attention is so focused that everything else fades into the background, you achieve what Csikszentmihalyi calls “inner order” or “order in consciousness.”

- The Nine Elements of Enjoyment
  When people describe an enjoyable experience conducive to flow, they mention one or more of the following nine components:
  You’re able to concentrate on an activity for an extended period of time.
  The task has a clear goal.
  You receive immediate feedback on your progress.
  You have the skills to complete the task.
  You feel a sense of control.
  You’re absorbed in the task, and it feels almost effortless. You’re not thinking about stresses from the rest of your life.
  Your sense of time is altered. You either feel like time passes quickly or that it has slowed in a helpful way.
  You don’t feel self-conscious, and your sense of self emerges stronger.
  The experience is autotelic: You want to repeat it because it was so enjoyable.

- Finding meaning that gives order to your consciousness and life is the meaning of life. This involves alternating between focusing on yourself and focusing on the world around you, differentiating yourself from others in your community, and becoming more integrated into your community.
