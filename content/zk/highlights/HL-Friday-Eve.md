## Highlights
- Perceptions Frame Realities
  Summary:
  First impressions are formed in a matter of minutes, often even seconds, and these initial perceptions heavily influence our understanding of others.
  As we interact, our mental representations of individuals become more fixed, leading us to selectively filter out aspects that do not conform to our preconceived notions. This creates a reinforced but potentially distorted identity of both ourselves and others, highlighting a cognitive bias where the desire to maintain a coherent image overrides the nuances of reality.
  Our understanding is often rooted in a preconceived notion of identity that operates on an unconscious level, shaping how we perceive ourselves and those around us.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  That probably when we meet someone for the first time we have five minutes or maybe even just one minute to see them and then after that the accretion start and we build up an internal picture Of who they are and because I'm relying on the usefulness of my image of you to predict something about you, I need to be very careful how much of you, as you actually are, I allow into my Picture. So in fact, I want to edit a lot of you out so that I can hang on to the fact that I know who you are. So it's a kind of profound stupidity and blindness in the maintenance of knowledge, whether it's knowledge of oneself or knowledge of other people. Identity is based on a foreclosure. Before we even enter into the field of phenomena, we're starting with an idea, an idea of self. This is how I am, an idea of other people, what I like, what I don't like. And of course that's operating on, often, a somewhat subconscious level.
