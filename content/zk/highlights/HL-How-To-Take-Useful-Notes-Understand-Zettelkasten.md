## Highlights
- Zettelkasten Values
  We are uncovering better ways of notetaking by doing it and helping others do it. Through this work we have come to value:
  - Connecting over Collecting
  - Flexibility over Structure
  - Tags over Folders
  - Writing over Copying
  That is, while there is value in the items on the right, we value the items on the left more.
