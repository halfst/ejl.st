## Highlights
- science tries to retrofit the “subjective” world of experiences onto this “objective” world. That is, without adding anything else to its worldview, it wants to explicate consciousness as arising out of the mindless actions of a gazillion molecules. It is here, however, that science runs into metaphysical difficulties.

- The reduction of the experience of the “self” during intense physical-mental exertions that demand full concentration is known to athletes, soldiers, or fly-fishers as being *in the flow*, *in the zone*, or *in peak experience*. The complete abolition of the sense of self has been reported by many, throughout history, as experiencing a bright light or a luminous expanse, losing the sense of having a body, being someone with a particular history and agency, and a slowing or even a complete cessation of the passage of time. Such experiences can leave deep contentment and awe or even ecstasy in their wake. When the mental barriers that define us as individuals fade away, when the gravitational field of the self has lost its dominion over consciousness, the mind merges with the universe itself. The distinction between the individual and the world dissolves. They become one and the same.

- The mind is not the passive recipient of sensory data streaming in from eyes, ears, and other sensors, from which it derives an unambiguous description of what is out there. No, the mind constructs what it takes to be “reality”—seeing this chair, hearing music, feeling guilty—from explicit and implicit assumptions about statistical regularities in the world around and within us.

- *Neuroplasticity*, the modern understanding that the brain retains an ability to rewire itself, enables us to actively mold how we interpret and understand ourselves. We are not just helpless victims of fate but are the agents in charge of our own narrative, for better or worse, victorious or defeatist. This forceful shaping of our attitudes to events beyond our control has profound consequences for well-being and sickness.

- *integrated information theory*, a quantitative, causal account of consciousness. Its development over the past twenty years has drawn in neuroscientists, neurologists, physicists, computer engineers, and philosophers as it makes startling, controversial (to some), but testable claims concerning who is conscious, of what, and why. According to the theory, consciousness is unfolded intrinsic causal power, the ability to effect change, a property associated with any system of interacting components, be they neurons or transistors. Consciousness is a structure, not a function, a process, or a computation.

- Against the grain, integrated information theory radically disagrees with this functionalist view. It argues from first principles that digital computers can (in principle) do everything that humans can do, eventually even faster and better. But they can never be what humans are. Intelligence is computable, but consciousness is not.

- I will focus on the way experiences appear or feel, without analyzing the content of these appearances or feelings. This is known as *phenomenology*, a term derived from *phenomenon*, which means “that which appears.” When Eminem sings, “I can’t tell you what it really is, I can only tell you what it feels like,” he takes a phenomenological point of view.

- The self can become aware of its own experiences, as in “Hmm, my toe is hurting. Maybe I should have bought those shoes in a larger size.” This is *meta-consciousness*: becoming conscious of an experience, a form of self-reflective introspection, consciousness being mirrored by the self. This operation can be applied recursively to itself; that is, you can become conscious that you’re conscious of your toe hurting. Meta-consciousness involves selectively attending to an experience, which changes the character of the experience, rendering it more salient. I

- Indeed, some psychologists argue that much of thinking is carried out unconsciously; what is consciously accessible are the projections of these thoughts onto the visual, auditory, or linguistic processing machinery in the brain. That is, when you are thinking, “I need to book a ticket to Venice,” accompanied by images of the lagoon of Venice, of an airplane, perhaps of a map of Italy, the cognitive work associated with planning such a trip and turning these plans into action is done away from consciousness’s limelight.[6](private://read/01j8xs746qfm1mq2ke1yf8b57m/#en0021en)

- Emotions and percepts differ in a couple of ways. While percepts are short-lived (you quickly adapt to any sustained stimulus, such as a pungent odor or the rumbling of a car engine and cease to smell or hear it), feelings usually ebb and flow slowly and can persist for long times.

- Percepts, by and large, are not experienced as good or bad. Often an image, a song, or a smell will trigger a memory with powerful positive or negative emotions, but shorn of such associations, percepts lack the affective component that marks emotions: seeing or hearing is experienced as neutral. Emotions, on the other hand, are defined by their valence; these can be either negative, such as fear, or positive, such as romantic love.

- The stream metaphor is, despite its powerful appeal, misleading in at least three ways. First, there is evidence to suggest that each experienced “now” is a discrete snapshot in time, akin to watching a film, which is essentially a series of stills, with each stationary frame rapidly being replaced by the next one. How long each moment lasts by the clock can vary, subject to attention, arousal, motivation, and so on. This would explain moments of protracted duration reported upon in the context of accidents, falls, or other life-threatening events—“When I fell, I saw my life flash before me” or “It took him ages to lift the gun and aim at me.”[12](private://read/01j8xs746qfm1mq2ke1yf8b57m/#en0027en) Second, consciousness of the passage of time, slower or faster, can be altogether suspended, as during psychedelic experiences when the passage of time may cease altogether, a topic I pick up in a few pages. Third, the flow of the stream of consciousness, or, perhaps more accurately, the string of conscious moments, like pearls on a necklace, is periodically interrupted by episodes of unconsciousness, when you fall asleep.

- Can there be an experience not involving seeing, hearing, fearing, wanting? This might bear some resemblance to what long-term practitioners of Buddhist meditation describe as sheer or naked awareness attained during *samadhi*, the complete cessation of all mental content, quieting and stilling consciousness until it is suspended in a luminosity of nothingness.

- Indubitably, patients suffer; yet the causes of their suffering and the extent to which their conscious or unconscious mind, responding to stress and anxiety, influences their symptoms remain controversial. Patients react with anger at any suggestion that their problems are psychosomatic in nature, for that implies that it is “all in their head” or that they choose to be sick for a nefarious purpose. Instead, they cast about for a physical cause: nerve gas, sonic weapons, vaccination, electric power lines, and so on. It is far easier to believe that those debilitating aches are caused by some unidentified agent than, say, that they are the body’s learned reaction to anxiety, leaving a hypervigilant nervous system in its wake.

- When I am in a truly dreamless sleep, there are no experiences; there is nothing; I do not exist for myself. My sleeping body is there, in bed, breathing in and out, for others to observe. But not for me. This is *relative,* or *extrinsic, existence*; existence for others. Stars, rocks, cars, and garbage cans exist in this derivative manner, only for others, not for themselves.
  When I wake up, groggily groping to turn off the alarm on my phone, I come from nowhere into being. This mind hears a jarring sound and senses a supine body, without yet even being fully aware of where it is or what day it is. But at that point, the conscious mind exists already for itself, intrinsically. It doesn’t have to experience anything exalted, mystical, or searing. Just *being* without much conscious content is entirely sufficient for *intrinsic existence.* Being as compared to nonbeing. This is *absolute existence*, the only existence worth having.

- Causal power is not some intangible notion but rather something quite concrete: the extent to which something can be the source of change—say, the fact that those three neurons over there being simultaneously on will cause that neuron over here to go off. It is the ability of the system’s recent past to specify its present state (cause power) and the extent to which the present state specifies its immediate future state (effect power).

- The first axiom is *intrinsicality*. This means that any experience is subjective, existing for itself, not for others. It exists from the intrinsic perspective, from within, not from an outsider’s perspective.
  The second axiom is *information*. Every experience is specific. It feels a particular way to read this book. If it were different, it would not be this experience.
  The third axiom is *integration*. It reflects the unitary, undivided nature of every experience.

- A specific physical mechanism in a particular state—a circuit with these neurons turned on and those turned off—that satisfies all five postulates is the substrate of a particular conscious experience. In the case of the brain, this physical substrate is also known as the *neural correlates of consciousness* (NCC).[14](private://read/01j8xs746qfm1mq2ke1yf8b57m/#en0107en)
  However, the theory is not limited to brain-based experiences. Indeed, it is agnostic as to whether the substrate is a nervous system, an extended root system of a tree, electrical currents circulating in an ocean of superfluid helium II on a lone exoplanet wandering between the stars, or silicon circuitry. However, to keep things simple, I’ll remain focused on the brain, picking up the theme of machine consciousness in the final chapter.

- Integration means that the substrate of consciousness must have cause-effect power that is unitary: the substrate must not be reducible to separate subsets that do not exist for themselves. Nor must the distinctions and relations they specify. Their degree of irreducibility is measured by integrated information, a number symbolized by the lowercase Greek letter phi, written as φ, and pronounced *fi*. The sum of the φ’s of all distinctions and relations is the integrated information of the circuit in this state, symbolized by the uppercase letter phi, Φ. This number measures the irreducibility of the substrate. Something with no integrated information does not exist as an integrated entity, as it can be reduced to two or more subsystems without any loss. The more integrated the information, the more irreducible the substrate, the more it exists for itself, the more it is conscious.

- Integrated information theory has no requirement that a brain must house only a single substrate of consciousness. Provided they do not causally overlap, there might be one large substrate, a maximum of integrated information, that includes part of Broca’s area and houses the egoic consciousness that can speak about its experiences, peacefully coexisting with another, nonoverlapping region of neocortex in the same brain that is also a local maximum of cause-effect power.

It instantiates the automatic, “thoughtless” processes that silently coordinate sensory information streaming in from stretch and position sensors embedded in muscles and joints, as well as the equilibrium organs in the inner ear and the eyes, with the motor commands that go out to the hundreds of muscles in the limbs and trunk.

- Similarly, invertebrates, such as bees and cephalopods, display complex cognition and capabilities. Yet they have no extended sheetlike neural architecture. Should we deny them sentience because they do not have a neocortex? No! The evolutionary and behavioral evidence is compatible with the thesis that all animals are sentient to a larger or smaller degree. This is also the prediction of integrated information theory. Given the ten-times-greater circuit density of the tiny brain of a bee (compared to the mammalian neocortex), with its approximately one million neurons wired up in stunningly complex patterns, it too will have a cause-effect structure with a nonzero amount of integrated information. It too is likely to experience some degree of contentment, flying in the warm rays of the sun, carrying a load of golden nectar back to its sisters in the hive.[49](private://read/01j8xs746qfm1mq2ke1yf8b57m/#en0164en) Indeed, it may be that every organism on the tree of life feels-like-something, is sentient, although its phenomenal content may take a primitive form unrecognizable to us.[50](private://read/01j8xs746qfm1mq2ke1yf8b57m/#en0165en)

- Psychiatrist Judson Brewer, at the time at the Yale University School of Medicine, discovered that these “open” or “closed” states of consciousness map onto activities of the posterior cingulate cortex and precuneus complex, part of the neocortical regions engaged when ruminating, introspecting, and daydreaming. Anger and anxiety, paradigmatic “closed” states, are associated with high activity in these regions; this activity is reduced by mindfulness training that minimizes excessive self-scrutiny by focusing on the here and now. Put differently, the neural signature of a preoccupied and worried self, the substrate of closed experiences, is activity in the posterior cingulate cortex and precuneus complex. When this activity is at an ebb, the self is disengaged, and the conscious mind is open to the world at large.[22](private://read/01j8xs746qfm1mq2ke1yf8b57m/#en0191en)

- No one, no matter how wise or intelligent, has privileged access to the one and only “true” reality. Indeed, no one has direct, unmediated access to the noumenal, unknowable reality that Immanuel Kant postulated, the *thing-in-itself*. What we perceive, what we experience, is a construct of the brain, shaped by our implicit and explicit expectations. If we believe something to be true, if it fits into our belief system, we are more likely to notice it and to remember it. If it does not reinforce our prior beliefs, we will ignore the facts of the matter to the extent possible.

This is astonishing to most, since we humans instinctively assume that our brains must harbor something extra, some fancy, super-powerful thingamajig not shared by any other species. But there is no evidence for that. Our brain has lots of minute, molecular differences, tweaks to the basic neuronal machinery, but so does every other species, each one according to its own ecological niche.

- Consciousness is not a clever algorithm. Its beating heart is intrinsic causal power, not computation. Causal power is not something intangible, ethereal, but something physical—the extent to which the system’s recent past specifies its present state (cause power) and the extent to which this current state specifies its immediate future (effect power). And here’s the rub: causal power, the ability to influence oneself, cannot be simulated. Not now or in the future. It must be built into the system, part of the physics of the system.
  To illustrate this intuitively, consider computer code that simulates the field equations of Albert Einstein’s celebrated theory of general relativity, relating mass to spacetime curvature. The software accurately models the supermassive black hole, called Sagittarius A*, located at the center of our galaxy, the Milky Way. This black hole exerts such extensive gravitational effects on its surroundings that nothing, not even light, can escape its attraction.
  To absolutely no one’s surprise, the astrophysicist simulating the black hole doesn’t get sucked into their laptop by the simulated gravitational field. Of course they don’t. Why should they? This seemingly absurd question emphasizes the difference between the real and the simulated. For if the simulation is faithful to reality, spacetime should warp around the laptop, creating a black hole that swallows everything around it. But it doesn’t. Why not?
  The answer is that gravity is not a computation. If it were, then the physics simulation engine should affect the gravitational field around the computer. Gravity has extrinsic causal powers, attracting anything with mass. Imitating a black hole’s causal powers requires an actual superdense sphere about four million times the mass of our sun. Causal power can’t be simulated; it must be constituted. Aspects of gravity can be simulated but not its raw causal powers.[13](private://read/01j8xs746qfm1mq2ke1yf8b57m/#en0265en)

Since only consciousness truly exists for itself, only a conscious entity can freely decide.[14](private://read/01j8xs746qfm1mq2ke1yf8b57m/#en0280en)
