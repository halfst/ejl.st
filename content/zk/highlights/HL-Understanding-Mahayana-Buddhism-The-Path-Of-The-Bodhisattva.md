## Highlights
- Zen Buddhism, a school of Mahayana Buddhism, is known for its emphasis on direct experience and the practice of meditation. Originating in China as Chan Buddhism, Zen later spread to Japan and other parts of the world. The term "Zen" is derived from the Sanskrit word "Dhyana," which means meditation. Zen Buddhism is characterized by its focus on simplicity, mindfulness, and the realization of one's true nature through direct, non-conceptual experience.
