## Highlights
- Seize the Moment: Action Beats Inaction
  Summary:
  The path to achievement begins with action rather than waiting for ideal circumstances or clarity.
  Procrastination is a form of deception—each moment lost is an opportunity missed. Embrace the philosophy of immediate action, recognizing that the present is the only guaranteed time to act.
  Every delay only diminishes future chances, reinforcing the urgency to begin now instead of deferring to tomorrow.
  Today is the right time to take steps toward your goals.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  You gotta start some time. You could wait for the perfect moment. You could wait for things to get clear. You could wait, as we've all been saying for years now, for things to go back to normal. Or you could get started. You could stop being the fool, the one that Seneca talks about, the one who was always getting ready. You could start demanding, as Epictetus instructed, the best for yourself. You could stop lying. It's the biggest lie in the we said in a daily stoic video. Stop telling yourself I'll do it in the morning. Do it now. Get started. Begun is half done. Do it now. Tempest, Fugue it. Memento, Mori. You can't know when you're gonna get another chance. The time that passes the opportunities you pass on, they are as good as dead. You are a little bit more dead. So don't do it later. Do it now. Today.
