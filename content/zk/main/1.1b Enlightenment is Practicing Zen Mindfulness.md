## Content

Enlightenment isn't some special state of mind to achieve. It can be found by expanding Zen practice throughout daily life.

> Enlightenment is not some good feeling or some particular state of mind. The state of mind that exists when you sit in the right posture is, itself, enlightenment. 
> -Shunryu Suzuki [^1]
