Dualism is the concept that there are unique pairs of opposites within the world that manifest as subject and object, self and other, good and bad, etc. Dualism asserts a separation between the divine and the natural, the mind and the body, the spiritual and the material. Most of western philosophy is dualistic in nature.[^1]
