## Content

Among its many shortcomings, physicalism struggles at its most elemental level: to describe what is physical. Because of quantum mechanics, quantum entanglement, and non-locality, what we think of as physical isn't clearly defined.[^1] Two particles separated by a universe can be entangled such that the observation of a state change in one indicates an instantaneous state change in the other. This kind of physics creates a kind of first-person effect where we create the universe as we observe it. Physicality is poorly defined in these scenarios.
