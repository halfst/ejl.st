## Content

The disease of the human condition is confusing the world of symbols for the world of reality. We accrue money, which exists only on paper, and physical things, which have limited utility to our happiness. Instead we need to embrace true reality and escape materialism and the world of symbols to understand the physical world and attain spiritual peace.[^1]
