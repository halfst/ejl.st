## Content

Buddhist temples probably have so many cats around because the monks have taken a vow to not harm any living creatures, [^1] including mice. Food is a common offering to monks and Buddha, so there is likely an overabundance of mice as well.

## Footnotes

[^1]: The practice of avoiding harm to any living creatures, intentionally or unintentionally, is rooted in the principle of *ahisma*, or non-violence. For this same reason, monks in some traditions will sweep the ground in front of them as they walk in order to avoid stepping on any insects.
