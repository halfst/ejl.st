## Content

A zettelkasten is a unique collection of thoughts, a system for engaging with your ideas in a creative way. It is not meant to be a comprehensive database of summarized information, like a personal wiki. If you find yourself cataloging everything you know within your zettelkasten then you're doing it wrong.
