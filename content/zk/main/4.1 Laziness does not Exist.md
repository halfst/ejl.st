## Content

Laziness and procrastination aren't the result of a poor work ethic, but actually due to executive dysfunction, poor mood management, and a fundamental disconnect between the perception of the future self compared to our present self.[^1][^2] Procrastination may also be the result of anxiety, especially when the stakes are high.[^3]
