## Content

Your identity and ego are continuously in flux, with the "you" that you are being defined as the average of your behaviors, choices, thoughts, ideals, relationships, etc., over any given period of time. It's possible for other people's perceptions of your identity to also change over time, as their beliefs about who you are are reinforced or challenged.

- See: [[2.1 Time is a Man-made Concept]] for a view of time which invalidates this argument, as the only ego that can be defined is who you are right now in the present moment.
