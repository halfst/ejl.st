## Content

Computers are incapable of consciousness, as it is defined by Integrated Information Theory (IIT). Although we may be soon to discover an artificial superintelligence (ASI) that may be more intelligent than humans, it's impossible for such an intelligence to be sentient and have freewill.

> Intelligence is computable, but consciousness is not.
> - Christof Koch[^1]

Consciousness is not Turing-compatible. Computers do not, and cannot, possess freewill.[^2] This is due to the fact that consciousness is defined by a structure rather than a computation.[^3]
