## Content

The distance between two points which follow an irregular border, such as a length of a coastline, will increase depending on the detail of the measurement. The finer the resolution, the greater this measurement becomes. The higher the resolution, the greater the complexity and the longer the coastline. Even if you were to stand on the coastline itself, it becomes even more complex the closer you view it, at the atomic and subatomic levels. The coastline itself becomes increasingly longer the more granularly it is measured. This is called the coastline paradox.[^1]
